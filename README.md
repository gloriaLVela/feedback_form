In this lab, you will create a feedback form using React functional components and manage user details using the useState hook. You will implement event handlers to manage form input changes, validate user inputs, and handle form submissions. Additionally, you will create a confirmation dialog using the confirm method to confirm user details before final submission. Upon successful submission, you will reset the form fields and display a thank you message to the user. This lab will give you practical experience building interactive forms and handling user inputs in React applications.
